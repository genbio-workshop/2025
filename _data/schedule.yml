  Abstract: In this talk, we highlight how we are using generative AI for antibiotic discovery and synthetic biology. In the first part of the talk, we focus on the Antibiotics-AI Project, which is a multi-disciplinary, innovative research program that is leveraging MIT's strengths in artificial intelligence, bioengineering, and the life sciences to discover and design novel classes of antibiotics. The Antibiotics-AI Project is focused on developing, integrating and implementing deep learning models and chemogenomic screening approaches: (1) to predict novel antibiotics from expansive chemical libraries with diverse properties, (2) to design de novo novel antibiotics based on learned structural and functional properties of existing and newly discovered antibiotics, and (3) to identify, using explainable deep learning models, the chemical structures and molecular mechanisms underlying the newly discovered and/or designed antibiotics.Our platform has been designed so that it can be utilized and applied in a rapid fashion to emerging and re-emerging bacterial pathogens, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria. In the second part of the talk, we focus on synthetic biology, which is an emerging field that is bringing together engineers, computer scientists and biologists to model, design and construct biological circuits out of proteins, genes and other bits of DNA, and to use these circuits to rewire and reprogram organisms.  These re-engineered organisms are going to change our lives in the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, rapid diagnostic tests, and synthetic probiotics to treat infections and a range of complex diseases. We highlight recent efforts that use generative AI in the context of synthetic biology to create novel classes of diagnostics, therapeutics, and programmable molecular tools for the life sciences.

- Title: "Invited keynote talk: Design of new protein functions using deep learning"
  Presenter: David Baker
  Time: 10:00-11:00
  Abstract: Proteins mediate the critical processes of life and beautifully solve the challenges faced during the evolution of modern organisms.  The focus of our lab is the design of a new generation of proteins that address current-day problems not faced during evolution. In contrast to traditional protein engineering efforts which modify naturally occurring proteins, we design new proteins from scratch to optimally solve these problems. We develop and use deep learning methods to design these new proteins with new functions, produce synthetic genes encoding the designs, and characterize them experimentally. In this talk, I will describe the design of proteins to address current challenges in health, technology, and sustainability.

- Title: "Invited keynote talk: Agentic Generative Biomedicine"
  Time: 11:00-11:40
  Presenter: Martin Renqiang Min
  Abstract: Owing to the availability of large-scale multimodal biomedical data and advancement of AI technologies, generative biomedicine for simulating digital cells and patients becomes feasible, which will potentially disrupt drug discovery. In this talk, first I will introduce the concept of generative biomedicine. Then I will present a privacy-preserving framework that combines large language models with autonomous agents (generative models) to drive biomedical discovery. Finally, I will discuss some of our recent generative AI models for 3D molecule optimization, T-Cell Receptor design, and protein-protein complex sequence-structure co-design.
  Bio: Martin Renqiang Min is currently the head of the Machine Learning Department, NEC Laboratories America. He received his MSc and PhD degrees in Computer Science from Machine Learning Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto. He did a one-year postdoc at Yale University. His research interests include machine learning and biomedical informatics, focusing on representation learning, generative models, multimodal reasoning, generative biomedicine, and omics for personalized healthcare.
