<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The revolutionary crossroads between artificial intelligence (AI) and biology
is one of the most exciting frontiers of our time.
In this workshop, we will dive deeply into the implications
of generative AI for biological discovery, drug discovery, and translational medicine.
</p>
<p>
Over the past year, generative AI models have led to tremendous breakthroughs,
from image and text generation, to protein folding and design.
These recent successes illustrate the incredible potential of generative AI not
only for digital applications, but also for basic science and healthcare.
We are now able to predict protein structure from sequence alone; to
characterize the function and interactions of biomolecules; to design such
molecules never-before-seen in nature; and more.
The impacts are profound: through generative AI, we can systematically
understand and reprogram biology at an unprecedented level.
</p>
<p>
The goals of this workshop are to bridge the gap between the machine learning and biological
communities;
to connect leading researchers from both industry and academia;
and to gain
critical insights into the future of generative-AI-driven biology.
We look forward to your participation in this exciting discourse on the future of biology and AI.

<!-- Call for Papers -->
<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="call_for_papers">Call for Papers</h2>

<p>
We invite researchers, scientists, students, and industry professionals working in the domains of artificial intelligence, machine learning, computational biology, bioinformatics, and related areas to submit their original research or review papers.
The scope of this workshop includes, but not limited to, the following topics.
</p>

<h5>Designing and optimizing novel and useful biomolecules</h5>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Rational protein design:</b>
        Prediction and
        optimization of protein sequences and/or structures,
        incorporating constraints and prior
        knowledge
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Small molecule drug design:</b>
        Discovery and optimization of novel and
        effective small molecule therapeutics, incorporating information
        about the biological context
    </li>
    <li><b>Next frontiers of de-novo design:</b>
        Designing other biomolecules including
        peptides, oligonucleotides, antibodies, or targeted degraders
    </li>

</ul>

<h5>From first principles: generative modeling for biological data</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>Sequence-based methods:</b>
        large language models for protein / genomic sequences,
        sequence-based molecular design
    </li>
    <li><b>Graph-based methods:</b>
        generative learning on biological graphs and networks,
        e.g., molecular graphs, protein-protein interaction networks,
        genome-wide association graphs
    </li>
    <li><b>Geometric deep learning:</b>
        generative modeling of biological structures as
        point clouds, surfaces, and other geometric objects
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Open challenges in generative AI and biology (Special Track)</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>Large language models for scientific discovery:</b>
    literature summarization, structured information extraction, identifying
    knowledge gaps and uncovering novel connections, formulation of scientific
    hypotheses</li>
    <li><b>Finding common ground:</b>
