<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<!--<p>
The revolutionary crossroads between artificial intelligence (AI) and biology
is one of the most exciting frontiers of our time.
In this workshop, we will dive deeply into the implications
of generative AI for biological discovery, drug discovery, and translational medicine.
</p>-->
<p>
Over the past year, generative AI models have led to tremendous breakthroughs,
from image and text generation, to protein folding and design.
These recent successes illustrate the incredible potential of generative AI not
only for digital applications, but also for basic science and healthcare.
We are now able to predict protein structure from sequence alone; to
characterize the function and interactions of biomolecules; to design such
molecules never-before-seen in nature; and more.
The impacts are profound: through generative AI, we can systematically
understand and reprogram biology at an unprecedented level.
</p>
<p>
The goals of this workshop are to bridge the gap between the machine learning and biological
communities;
to connect leading researchers from both industry and academia;
and to gain
critical insights into the future of generative-AI-driven biology.
We look forward to your participation in this exciting discourse on the future of biology and AI.
